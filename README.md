# Fourside
First ever HTML / CSS project about a SNES video game.

When I get some time I will rewrite a lot of the code in PHP to clean it up. 
Also, I need to compress pictures to decrease loading times.

TODO: Organize pages into folders
TODO: Format page layouts with JS (Since everything is client side code)
